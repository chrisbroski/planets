Exobiologist
============

This is the game: find life on other worlds.

Start with a ship that can travel, basically, anywhere. (Let's not worry about how. This game is about life on other worlds and I'd like to focus on that.) The ship contains 2 probes that can remotely collect samples of air, water and soil. The ship has no lander (yet) but it does have lots of lab equipment - intelligent microscopes, molecular analysis tools, and terrariums capable of simulating a variety of living conditions.

One if the most important jobs of the exobiologist is the certification of planets that have no indigenous life. Once a planet has been shown as guaranteed free of life, it is opened to mining and colonization. Gas giants and extreme temperature planets are not worth much. Ice planets have value and are common, but finding an Earth-like planet without any life is worth a fortune. The value of life-free planets are not because of hippie ecological reasons, but because we learned the hard way what H. G. Wells knew in the 1800s - life is hostile. Some alien life is highly deadly to Earth life, and Earth life can decimate other types of life. Most of the time they mess with each other, and it can time time to know which side gets the worst of it.

You won't have enough testing equipment to guarantee a planet life-free at first, but there is plenty of work identifying possible life-free planets and cataloging basic life forms. Basic testing of hostility to and from Earth life. Collection of smaller megafauna and determining the conditions to keep them alive.

## Gameplay

Push a button to visit an unexplored system or choose one from your history.

View a description of the system with all planets and moons. Choose which one to explore.

Get detailed information about the planet, mostly temperature at equator, poles, night and day sides. At first you can choose where to send the remotes to gather samples, but eventually
you can land the ship and get out and explore on foot.

Run tests on the samples: Find anything living? Get a description. Test hostility to and from Earth life. Study what it eats and learn to keep it alive in a bio chamber.

You get money for doing those things. Upgrade your ship, get new testing equipment, larger bio chambers and traps.
