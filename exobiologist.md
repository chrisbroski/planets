Exobiologist
============

This is the game: find life on other worlds.

Start with a ship that can travel, basically, anywhere. (Let's not worry about how. This game is about life on other worlds and I'd like to focus on biology, not physics and technology.) The ship contains 2 probes that can remotely collect samples of air, water, or soil. The ship has no lander (yet) but it does have lots of lab equipment - intelligent microscopes, molecular analysis tools, and habitat chambers capable of simulating a variety of living conditions.

One if the most important jobs of the exobiologist is the certification of planets that have no indigenous life. Once a planet has been shown as guaranteed free of life, it is opened to mining and colonization. Gas giants and extreme temperature planets are not worth much. Discovering life-free ice planets have value and are common, but finding an pre-Earth planet without any life is worth a fortune. (They will need to be terraformed before people can live on the surface.) The value of life-free planets are not because of hippie ecological reasons, but because we learned the hard way what H. G. Wells knew in the 1800s - life is hostile. Some alien life is highly deadly to Earth life, and Earth life can decimate other types of life. Most of the time they mess with each other, and it can take time to know which side gets the worst of it.

You won't have enough testing equipment to guarantee a planet life-free at first, but there is plenty of work identifying possible life-free planets and cataloging basic life forms. Basic testing of hostility to and from Earth life. Collection of smaller megafauna and determining the conditions to keep them alive.

## Gameplay

Push a button to visit an unexplored system or choose one from your history.

View a description of the system with all planets and moons. Choose which one to explore.

Get detailed information about the planet, mostly temperature at equator, poles, night and day sides. At first you can choose where to send the remotes to gather samples, but eventually
you can land the ship and get out and explore on foot.

Run tests on the samples: Find anything living? Get a description. Test hostility to and from Earth life. Study what it eats and learn to keep it alive in a bio chamber.

You get money for doing those things. Upgrade your ship, get new testing equipment, larger bio chambers and traps.

## Money

In addition to a standard salary, ship, and basic lab equipment, an exobiologist earns:

1¤ - Gather a specific specimen
1¤ - Describe a new life form
5¤ - Describe a unique new life form
10¤ - Basic hostility test
100¤ - Advanced hostility test (this takes at least a year)
100¤ - Certify planet to be life-free
20¤ - In-depth, definitive study of a single creature.*

(*You make the most money the fastest with high quantity of planets/organisms, but to become an expert you will need to create the definitive guide to something. Also, some players may enjoy in-depth study so I want to make sure it is economically feasible.)

## Zoos

If after an advanced hostility test it is still not proven to be hostile to Earth life,
unique life forms can be submitted to zoological exhibitions. Zoos are typically constructed on "desert" planets - those with qualities hostile to nearly all life forms. These are typically dry and rocky with little to no atmosphere. Zoos are popular for family vacations and educational trips. Each separate building in a zoo complex houses creatures from a single planet.

Keeping alien life alive for long periods of time is not always possible, so zoos will contract out exobiologists to replenish popular exhibits.

## Levels

The player starts at an *apprentice* level and works up to *journeyman*. From there they may take several career routes (non-committal - the player can change careers at any time.)

### Zoologist

Specializes in acquiring and housing mega-fauna. The master zoologist will own her own zoo / educational institution.

### Ecologist

Ecologists are experts of the life of an entire planet and study how each creature affects the others. Masters will have a camp (or camps) on their planet for study and tourism.

### Explorer

Explorer value breadth of knowledge by cataloging the common species on as many planets as possible. They are most able to discern which creatures are truly unique in the universe, as opposed to to just more of the same.

### Specialist

Specialists dive deep into a certain type of creature. Zoos occasionally need expertise on a specific creature they are having trouble with.

### Experimentalist

Experimentalists improve and invent tools and tests for biological study.

### Pathologist

These folks are the last word on the hostility of a planet's creatures. they not only study the mechanisms of predation, infection, and parasitism, but also how to prevent and cure them.

### Terraformer

In order to transform a planet into a new Earth quickly and reliably, creatures must be engineered to prepare the water, land and air.
