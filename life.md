Based on Food Types
-------------------

### Autotrophs

The basis of all life are things that can survive only with chemical and physical properties of their environment. These require an energy or chemical gradient.

#### Food

##### Photosynthesis

The main type we see on Earth are photosynthetic. I'd expect the use of a star's energy to be common elsewhere.

##### Chemosynthesis

Hydrogen, Hydrogen sulfide, Sulfur, FeO, Mn, and Ammonia can be used as an energy source to convert CO2 in to methane.

Chemotrophs will usually have small populations. The amount of available fuel is typically limited. On Earth, these are only Prokaryotes.

##### Thermosynthesis

An electrical current can be created from a temperature gradient (as in a Peltier heat pump.) A gradient could be made in ambient heat with shade or evaporative cooling.

##### Electrosynthesis

An electron gradient could be created by natural forces. A living creature could conceivably use this for chemical synthesis, though I am not certain how.

#### Anchored/Free Floating

They could actively swim too. Anchored creatures will need a way to mate and spread its seeds.

#### Collectors

Leaves, typically for energy, but who know how electrical and heat gradient collectors would work?

They would also need a method of collecting raw materials from adjacent gasses and liquids.

### Herbivores

Creatures that eat only autotrophs.

### Carnivores

Creatures that eat herbivores, other carnivores, and even autotrophs (omnivores.)

### Decomposers

Creatures that eat the dead stuff lying around. Fungus, bacteria, worms, etc. They could also become infectious or parasitic if their food source isn't quite dead.

### Hybrid

We sometimes see cooperation between producers and consumers, such as in the lichen. Anchored autotrophs could attach to mobile heterotrophs for better positioning of its require energy or nutrient sources, plus spreading seeds and pollen. It could return some energy to its host in payment.

Complexity
----------

The age of the planet should affect the level of life complexity. Not sure how, so we'll just

Let's divide the life cycle of a planet into 8 sections of 500 million years each.

1. Prokaryotic Chemotrophs I
2. Prokaryotic Chemotrophs II (colonies)
3. Prokaryotic Photo/Termo/Electrotrophism I (colonies)
4. Prokaryotic Photo/Termo/Electrotrophism II (stromatolites, threads)
5. Eukaryotic Single-cell and single-tissue multicellular creatures (Porifera, fungus, algae, lichen, non-vascular land plants)
6. Eukaryotic 2-tissue multicellular creatures (Cnidaria, vascular plants)
7. Eukaryotic 3-tissue organisms
8. Post-technology apocalypse (like #7 but with ruins)

### Precambrian

The most common types of life will be this. The history of life on Earth is 3.5 billion years, 3 billion of which were Precambrian.

#### Prokaryotes

The simplest design for a living thing is prokaryotic. This is a capsule filled with the chemicals necessary for respiration and reproduction. They can form simple structures such as mats and threads. It is rare that prokaryotic cells form multicellular organisms.

#### Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic cells are the next level up - a membrane containing multiple prokaryotic descended cells (organelles) working together.

#### Single-layer Multicellular

These are very simple megaflora and megafauna. Algae, fungus, Dickensonia, sponges, etc.

#### Dual-layer Multicellular

Jellyfish, anemones, and corals are constructed with two different types of tissues.

### Cambrian

The 3-tissue structure suddenly allows a multitude of morphological possibilities, starting with worms, then with crude shells (molluscs) and full carapace (arthropods.)

Life Cycle
----------

Patterns of behavior occur due to day/night cycle (inactivity and/or hiding from extreme weather) yearly cycle (migration, hibernation) and the age of the creature.

### Diurnal

Periods of activity and inactivity may coincide with the heat of midday and the cold of the night with the creature seeking its preferred climate and seeking shelter underground or in liquid during harsh cold, heat, or weather.

### Seasonal

If the planet is moderately close to its star and has a tilted axis, creatures may migrate to optimal climate as a yearly cycle, They may also choose to become dormant during harsh times.

### Developmental

Multicellular life starts as a single cell, which divides and differentiates to form the adult creature. The most straightforward path is gradually attaining a reproductive form (then death.) But many life forms that we know pass through significantly different forms, especially those suited to immature/reproductive life styles.

A development life cycle may span 1, 2 or many years.

### Reproductive

If a creature mates and spawns more than once during its life (iteroparus) it may alter its physical form
