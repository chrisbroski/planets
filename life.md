Life

Autotrophs
----------

The basis of all life are things that can survive only with chemical and physical properties of their environment. These require an energy or chemical gradient.

### Food

#### Radiation

The main type we see on Earth are photosynthetic. I'd expect the use of a star's energy to be common elsewhere.

#### Chemosynthesis

Hydrogen, Hydrogen sulfide, Sulfur, FeO, Mn, and Ammonia can be used as an energy source to convert CO2 in to methane.

Chemotrophs will usually have small populations. The amount of available fuel is typically limited. On Earth, these are only Prokaryotes.

#### Temperature

An electrical current can be created from a temperature gradient (as in a Peltier heat pump.) A gradient could be made in ambient heat with shade or evaporative cooling.

#### Electricity

An electron gradient could be created by natural forces. A living creature could conceivably use this for chemical synthesis, though I am not certain how.

### Anchored/Free Floating

They could actively swim too. Anchored creatures will need a way to mate and spread its seeds.

### Collectors

Leaves, typically for energy, but who know how electrical and heat gradient collectors would work?

They would also need a method of collecting raw materials from adjacent gasses and liquids.

Herbivores
----------

Creatures that eat only heterotrophs.

Carnivores
----------

Creatures that eat herbivores.

Decomposers
-----------

Creatures that eat the dead stuff lying around.
